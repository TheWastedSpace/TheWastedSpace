# 👾 Welcome to the Wasted Space 🚀

Hi (oﾟvﾟ)ノ
I’m Dean – dev by day, gamer by night, and no sleep in sight. (I'm a lyrical genius, ik 🎤✨)  
You’ll find me online as **@TheWastedSpace** and somewhere in Germany, usually building something weird, breaking something important and/or dying to a boss –  
and occasionally I read books and go to the gym, like a civilized human 🧘‍♂️📚.

### 🧠 Interests:
- 🧑‍💻 Programming
- 📚 Reading – mostly fantasy, scientific articles, and programming docs
- ❤️ My lil sister – I must protecc
- 🎮 Gaming – mostly indie titles, but I know the big ones too (for Christ’s sake, hit me up if you play Destiny 2)
- 🧑‍🎓 I **LOVE** teaching and learning stuff I or others are interested in
- 🏃‍♂️ Sports – so my back doesn’t die, i like being fit and ⬇️
- 🎭 Cosplay – just occasionally; I buy the outfits, no sewing involved
- 🎉 Partying – mostly for the dancing and meeting people (I don’t drink alc, though 🚱)

### 🛠️ What I'm working on:
#### Currently: GDScript  
This README might be outdated by the time you read it. But hey, that’s me :)

### 🤝 Wanna collaborate?
I know:
- C# (rusty, but you never really unlearn it)
- GDScript (whatever my progress on that is currently)
- Python (a bit)  
But I don’t mind diving into a new programming language if needed – though it takes time, of course ⏳



I’m open to:
- 🇬🇧↔️🇩🇪 Translation projects
- Some Game Dev stuff, but im not that good at the programming part 😅
- Play testing - i can break about anything (My nickname was once "the on purpose D.A.U.")
- Anything weird and creative

## 🤖 Standpoint on AI:
This README was created with the **help** of AI – not by blindly copy-pasting whatever it outputted.
No, I didn’t just copy-paste what it gave me – I provided a rough outline of what I wanted to express and it gave me something that was less rough.  
I use AI as a **tool**, not as a **replacement** for creative thinking - I personally can't stand people who do it that way.
Also, I probably wouldn’t have used this many emojis without it 😊👌👍 and fixing my gramar would take ages 🕒🕗 
So if u want ideas on how to **work with AI** – without letting it do all the work – hit me up! 😉

## 📬 Contact:
- Discord: `@thewastedspace` pretty much 18/7 (i need my sleep)
- GitHub, but i might take some time to respond

## ⚠️ Pronouns & Stuff:
I try to keep my language gender-neutral. Not political, just polite.
Way harder in German (der, die, das 💀), but i manage.
So just call me whatever, tho i'm a guy if u'r intrested.

## 🧩 Fun Fact:
In some countries, ADHD isn’t a disorder – it’s a personality.  
I chose to believe that 🥹
