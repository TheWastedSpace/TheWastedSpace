# 👾 Welcome to the Wasted Space 🚀

Hi (oﾟvﾟ)ノ  
I’m Dean – dev by day, gamer by night, and no sleep in sight. (I'm a lyrical genius, ik 🎤✨)


U’ll find me online as **@TheWastedSpace** and **@ThePokemonCasual** and somewhere in Germany, usually building something weird, breaking something important and/or dying to a boss.  
Occasionally I read books and go to the gym, like a civilized human.

### 🧠 Interests:
- 🧑‍💻 Programming
- 📚 Reading – mostly fantasy, scientific articles, and programming docs
- ❤️ My lil siblings – I must protecc 🛡️
- 🎮 Gaming – mostly indie titles, but I know the big ones too (for Christ’s sake, hit me up if u play Destiny 2)
- 🧑‍🎓 I **LOVE** teaching others and learning stuff I am interested in
- 🏃‍♂️ Sports – so my back doesn’t die, i like being fit and ⬇️
- 🎭 Cosplay – just occasionally; I buy the outfits, no sewing involved
- 🎉 Partying – mostly for the dancing and meeting people (I don’t drink alc, though 🚱)
- 🎤 Singing - only ok at it, but thats why it stays a hobby

### 🛠️ What I'm working on:
#### Currently: GDScript  
This README might be outdated by the time u read it. But hey, that’s me :)

### 🤝 Wanna collaborate?
I know:
- C# (rusty, but u never unlearn)
- GDScript (whatever my progress on that is currently)
- Python (a bit)  
But I don’t mind diving into a new programming language if needed – though it takes time, of course ⏳

I’m open to:
- `EN`↔️`DE` Translation projects
- 🎮 Some game dev stuff – but I'm only ok-ish at the programming part, so maybe i stick to the "refine ideas" and the "write story/dialouges" part 😅
- 🧪 Playtesting – I can break just about anything (my nickname was once "the on-purpose D.A.U." _`German IT Joke`_)
- 🎨 Anything weird and creative

## 🤖 Standpoint on AI:
This README was created with the **help** of AI – not by blindly copy-pasting whatever it output.  
I gave it a rough outline of what I wanted to express, and it gave me something that was less rough  
I use AI as a **tool**, not as a **replacement** for creative thinking – I honestly can't stand when people do that 🙅‍♂️  
Also, I probably wouldn’t have used this many emojis without it 😊👌👍  
And fixing my grammar manually would’ve taken ages 🕒🕗  
So if u want ideas on how to **work with AI** – without letting it do all the work – hit me up! 😉

## 📬 Contact:
- 💬 Discord: `@thewastedspace` – pretty much 18/7 (I need my sleep 😴)
- 🐙 GitHub – but I might take some time to respond

## ⚠️ Pronouns & Stuff:
I try to keep my language gender-neutral. Not political – just polite.  
Way harder in German (der, die, das 💀), but I manage.  
So just call me whatever – though I'm a guy, if u're curious

## 🧩 Fun Fact:
In some countries, ADHD isn’t a disorder – it’s a personality.  
I choose to believe that, instead of taking medicine - for now.
